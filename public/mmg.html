I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,

In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;

I know the croaking chorus from the Frogs of Aristophanes!

And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.

When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",
When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery--
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy,
You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.
